<h2>Context</h2>
Leader in France in the classified ads market, with more than 3 millions unique visitors a day, Leboncoin noticed that more and more people where accessing the website throught mobile and tablet device.

With an outdated website, it was time to evolve and bring to life a new responsive website.

<h2>Missons</h2>
Rework the whole website from Scratch, with new template, CSS and JS.

We still had to use the internal platform based on Blocket template, but we rewrited the CSS using SASS, a new file architecture, variables, mixins and animations.
We did the same with the Javascript, using class, prototype and modules instead of all the inline javascript previously.
It took 1 year for the rework, taking in consideration that we had to support browsers from IE8 to Chrome, and mobile/tablet from the Ipad1, Galaxy S2 to the latest.
